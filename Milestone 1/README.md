# Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing

## Overview  
This milestone focuses on building a solid foundation for healthcare data analysis by collecting, exploring, and preprocessing relevant datasets. The goal is to prepare high-quality data that can be used in subsequent modeling and predictive tasks.

---

## Objectives  
- Acquire healthcare datasets containing essential patient and clinical information.  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and issues.  
- Preprocess the data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for modeling.

---

## Tasks Summary

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Gather relevant healthcare datasets, including features such as:
  - Age  
  - Medical history  
  - Test results  
  - Treatments  
  - Patient outcomes
- Ensure data is structured and suitable for predictive modeling.

### 2. **Data Exploration**
- Conduct EDA to understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
- Identify:
  - Key variables and trends  
  - Feature distributions  
  - Missing values and outliers  
  - Potential data quality issues

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
- Address missing values (e.g., via imputation or removal).  
- Normalize or standardize features for model compatibility.  
- Encode categorical variables where necessary (e.g., medical conditions).
