# *3. Requirements Gathering*

## *Stakeholder Analysis*
Identifying key stakeholders and their needs:
- *Healthcare Professionals (Doctors, Radiologists, Oncologists):* Need accurate, fast, and interpretable AI predictions to assist in early lung cancer diagnosis.
- *Hospital Administrators:* Require predictive insights to optimize resource allocation and reduce patient readmission rates.
- *Patients & Caregivers:* Need clear and understandable risk assessments to make informed healthcare decisions.
- *Healthcare Data Analysts:* Require access to well-structured datasets for further analysis and performance monitoring.
- *Regulatory Bodies (e.g., HIPAA Compliance, Ministry of Health):* Ensure data privacy, security, and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## *User Stories & Use Cases*
### *User Story 1: Doctor Diagnosing a Patient*
*As a* doctor, *I want* to input a patient’s diagnostic data into the system *so that* I can receive an AI-generated lung cancer risk prediction to support my decision-making.

### *User Story 2: Hospital Resource Planning*
*As a* hospital administrator, *I want* to analyze historical patient data trends *so that* I can allocate resources effectively and prepare for patient inflow.

### *User Story 3: Patient Checking Health Risks*
*As a* patient, *I want* to receive a simplified report from the AI model *so that* I can understand my health risk and discuss it with my doctor.

## *Functional Requirements*
- *AI Model for Lung Cancer Detection:* Implement a deep learning-based classification system.
- *Data Processing Pipeline:* Ensure efficient preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering for healthcare datasets.
- *Model Training & Optimization:* Experiment with different ML techniques and optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- *Predictive Dashboard:* Develop a Power BI dashboard to visualize predictions and patient health insights.
- *API Deployment:* Build a REST API using Flask/FastAPI to integrate the AI model with hospital systems.
- *Performance Monitoring:* Implement MLOps practices to track model drift and automate retraining.

## *Non-functional Requirements*
- *Performance:* The model should return predictions within *5 seconds* for real-time usability.
- *Security:* Implement encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive healthcare data.
- *Usability:* The dashboard should have an intuitive UI for doctors and administrators to interpret results easily.
- *Reliability:* The system should maintain an *uptime of 99.5%*, ensuring continuous availability for healthcare professionals.
- *Compliance:* Adhere to *HIPAA* and other data protection regulations to ensure patient data privacy and ethical AI usage.

This section provides a structured approach to gathering requirements for the *Healthcare Predictive Analytics* project, ensuring that all stakeholders' needs are addressed effectively.
