# Healthcare Predictive Analytics: Lung Cancer Detection  

## Overview  

The **Healthcare Predictive Analytics** project leverages AI and machine learning to enhance early lung cancer detection, improving patient care and optimizing healthcare resource management. By developing predictive models, the system empowers healthcare professionals with data-driven insights to identify high-risk patients, recognize emerging health trends, and facilitate timely interventions.  

### Key Features  
✅ **AI-Powered Early Detection:** Machine learning models analyze medical data to detect lung cancer at early stages.  
✅ **Data-Driven Insights:** Identifies trends in patient health metrics, assisting healthcare providers in decision-making.  
✅ **Optimized Resource Management:** Helps hospitals allocate resources effectively based on predictive analytics.  
✅ **Scalable Deployment:** Built with MLOps best practices for real-time monitoring, retraining, and cloud-based deployment.
